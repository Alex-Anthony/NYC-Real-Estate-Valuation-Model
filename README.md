# NYC-Real-Estate-Valuation-Model

This study presents the development of a machine learning
model aimed at predicting future property values, utilizing
datasets from NYC Open Data. Initial focus was placed on data
pre-processing, where missing values were addressed through imputation techniques, and feature scaling was standardized to ensure the dataset was uniform. Cross-validation methodos allowed
for model performance assesments, and an evaluation of selected
classifiers. Experimentation with cross-validation techniques help
us to discover the most generalized model for our dataset.
Using GridSearchCV, parameter combinations were explored to
enhance model generalizability and accuracy. Evaluation metrics,
including ROC curves for classification tasks and error metrics
for regression models, were consistently reported throughout the
project. Visual representation of repeated stratified k-fold crossvalidation further developed model performance across multiple
iterations.
